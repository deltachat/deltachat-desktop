# Conversations 

React UI components for rendering conversations. 

Originally created by Signal Desktop. 

```
npm install conversations
```

## Usage

For now, you have to download the Roboto font to your fonts directory, as well as
install `intl-tel-input` and `emoji-panel` to get full css compatbility with
the components. 

```js
var {MessageBody, MessageDetail, ConversationListItem} = require('./conversations')
```

See `docs` for more info on available components.
