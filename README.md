**If you are upgrading:** please see [`UPGRADING.md`](UPGRADING.md).

### Build the app

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

### Run the app

```
$ npm start
```

The first `npm run build` step is optional and only needed if code has changed or if the app has never been built before.

### Watch the code

It is recommended to run this watch command in a separate terminal

```
$ npm run watch
```

## Configuration and databases

The configuration files and database are stored at [application-config's default filepaths](https://www.npmjs.com/package/application-config#config-location).

Each database is a sqlite file that represents the account for a given email address.

## Code structure

* `static`: static files used directly in the app
* `images`: image files used for the 'conversations' module. This should probably be moved to the module at some point..
* `src`: the original javascript source files, both for main and renderer
* `es5`: the compiled es5 source files for front-end
* `dist`: the final distributions and executables for all supported platforms
* `.tx`: configuration files for transifex
* `_locales`: source files for translations
* `bin`: misc. scripts
* `build`: files needed only at build time (for electron-builder)
* `conversations`: react components pulled out of signal

## How to Contribute

### Get the code

```
$ git clone https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-desktop.git
$ cd deltachat-desktop
$ npm install
```

### Troubleshooting

This module builds on top of `deltachat-core`, which in turn has external dependencies. Instructions below assumes a Linux system (e.g. Ubuntu 18.10).

If you get errors when running `npm install`, they might be related to the _build_ dependencies `meson` and `ninja`.

If `meson` is missing:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install meson
```

If `ninja` is missing:

```
sudo apt-get install ninja-build
```

You might also need the following system dependencies:

* `libssl-dev`
* `libsasl2-dev`
* `libsqlite3-dev`
* `zlib1g-dev`

To fix these issues do:

```
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libsasl2-dev libsqlite3-dev zlib1g-dev
```

Then try running `npm install` again.

Please see [build instructions](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core#building-your-own-libdeltachatso) for additional information.

### Run linters

```
$ npm test
```

### Run integration tests

```
$ npm run test-integration
```

The integration tests use Spectron and Tape. They click through the app, taking screenshots and
comparing each one to a reference. Why screenshots?

* Ad-hoc checking makes the tests a lot more work to write
* Even diffing the whole HTML is not as thorough as screenshot diffing. For example, it wouldn't
  catch an bug where hitting ESC from a video doesn't correctly restore window size.
* Chrome's own integration tests use screenshot diffing iirc
* Small UI changes will break a few tests, but the fix is as easy as deleting the offending
  screenshots and running the tests, which will recreate them with the new look.
* The resulting Github PR will then show, pixel by pixel, the exact UI changes that were made! See
  https://github.com/blog/817-behold-image-view-modes

For MacOS, you'll need a Retina screen for the integration tests to pass. Your screen should have
the same resolution as a 2016 12" Macbook.

For Windows, you'll need Windows 10 with a 1366x768 screen.

When running integration tests, keep the mouse on the edge of the screen and don't touch the mouse
or keyboard while the tests are running.

### Update translations

Install the [transifex-client](https://docs.transifex.com/client) and get added to the `Delta Chat Desktop` project.

When you add new strings that need to be translated, run:

```
tx push --source
```

And periodically we can run the following command to get the new translation
strings from translators:

```
tx pull --all
```

### Deploy workflow

1. Create a draft release on github, e.g. `vX.Y.Z`
1. Change `version` field in `package.json` to `X.Y.Z`
1. Commit and push modified `package.json` (repeat until release is ready)
1. Once done, publish the release on github, which will create the tag
