## Install <a id="install"></a>

The application can be downloaded from **<https://get.delta.chat>**. Here you'll find binary releases for all supported platforms. See below for platform specific instructions. If you run into any problems please consult the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.

### Linux <a id="linux"></a>

#### Flatpak <a id="flatpak"></a>

The primary distribution-independed way to install is to use the
flatpak build.
This is maintained in [it's own
repository](https://github.com/flathub/chat.delta.desktop), however a
pre-built binary can be downloaded and installed from
[flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/chat.delta.desktop) which
also has a setup guide for many Linux platforms.

#### Arch Linux <a id="arch-linux"></a>

> **WARNING: Currently the AUR package compiles from latest master. This can be more recent as the latest release, introduce new features but also new bugs.**

If you have a AUR helper like yay installed, you can install it by running `yay -S deltachat-desktop-git` and following the instruction in your terminal.

Otherwise you can still do it manually:

```sh
# Download the latest snapshot of the PKGBUILD
wget https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/snapshot/deltachat-desktop-git.tar.gz

# extract the archive and rm the archive file afterwards
tar xzfv deltachat-desktop-git.tar.gz && rm deltachat-desktop-git.tar.gz

# cd into extracted folder
cd deltachat-desktop-git

# build package
makepkg -si

# install package (you need to replace <version> with whatever version makepkg built)
sudo pacman -U deltachat-desktop-git-<version>.tar.xz
```

### Mac OS <a id="mac"></a>

### Homebrew

```
$ brew install --cask deltachat
```

### DMG

Simply install the `.dmg` file as you do it with all other software on mac.

If you are getting an openssl error message at the first start up you need to install openssl.

```
$ brew install openssl
```

### From Source <a id="source"></a>

> ⚠ This is mostly for development purposes, this won't install/integrate deltachat into your system.
> So unless you know what you are doing, we recomment to stick to the methods above if possible.

```sh
# Get the code
$ git clone https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-desktop.git
$ cd deltachat-desktop

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Build the app (only needed on the first time or if the code was changed)
$ npm run build

# Start the application:
$ npm start
```

### Troubleshooting <a id="troubleshooting"></a>

This module builds on top of `deltachat-core-rust`, which in turn has external dependencies. Instructions below assumes a Linux system (e.g. Ubuntu 18.10).

If you get errors when running `npm install`, they might be related to the _build_ dependency `rust`.

If `rust` or `cargo` is missing:
Follow the instruction on <https://rustup.rs/> to install rust and cargo.

Then try running `npm install` again.

If you still get errors look at the instructions in the deltchat-node and
deltachat-rust-core README files to set things up **or write an issue**.

## Configuration and Databases <a id="config-and-db"></a>

The configuration files and database are stored at [application-config's default filepaths](https://www.npmjs.com/package/application-config#config-location).

Each database is a sqlite file that represents the account for a given email address.

## How to Contribute <a id="how-to-contribute"></a>

Read [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)

## Logging <a id="logging"></a>

You can access the log folder and the current log file under the `View->Developer` menu:
