# Upgrade Guide

This document describes breaking changes and how to upgrade. For a complete list of changes including minor and patch releases, please refer to the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## v2.0.0

To improve the user experience with `Delta Chat` using multiple devices, we experimentally changed the behaviour of `Delta Chat`. Therefore, beginning with this release, we aren't compatible with the **old android client** which you can currently find in the f-droid store. Please use the **new development** version. You can find it [here](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-android-ii/releases).
