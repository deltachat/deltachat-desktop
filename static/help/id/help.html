<p>By default, Delta Chat shows all e-mails.</p>

<p>At “Settings -&gt; Chats &amp;
Media -&gt; Show Classic E-Mails”, you can change this. You have these options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“No, chats only”: Only messages sent by other Delta Chat users and replies to
your Delta Chat messages are shown. This makes most sense if you use the same
e-mail account for normal e-mails as well.</li>
  <li>“All”: Delta Chat shows all e-mails that are sent to your email address. This
makes sense if you want to use Delta Chat for all your e-mails, so no message
gets lost. This is the default setting.</li>
  <li>“For accepted contacts”: Delta Chat shows all e-mails from contacts with whom
you already have a chat, but new chats only pop up for Delta Chat messages.
This helps to decide on a case-by-case basis whether you want to have a
conversation in Delta Chat or in a “normal” e-mail app.</li>

  <li>If a message comes from an unknown contact, it appears as a <strong>request</strong>. You
need to accept the request before you can reply.</li>
  <li>You can also “delete” it if you don’t want to chat with them for now. This
does <em>not</em> delete the message on the server, only on your device. So you can
still deal with the message in a different mail app.</li>
  <li>If you delete a request, future messages from that contact will still appear
as message request, so you can change your mind. If you really don’t want to
receive messages from this person, consider <em>blocking</em> them.</li>

<p>Seperti program E-Mail lainnya seperti Thunderbird, K9-Mail, atau Outlook,
program membutuhkan kata sandi sehingga Anda dapat menggunakannya untuk mengirim email. Tentu saja,
kata sandi hanya disimpan di perangkat Anda. Kata sandi hanya dikirimkan ke
penyedia E-Mail Anda (saat Anda login), yang tetap memiliki akses ke email Anda.</p>

<p>Jika Anda menggunakan penyedia E-Mail dengan dukungan OAuth2 seperti gmail.com atau yandex.ru,
tidak perlu menyimpan kata sandi Anda di perangkat. Dalam hal ini, hanya
token akses digunakan.</p>

<p>Karena Delta Chat adalah Open Source, Anda dapat memeriksa file <a href="https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/blob/master/src/login_param.rs">Source

<p>Use these tools to organize your chats and keep everything in its place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pinned chats</strong> always stay atop of the chat list. You can use them to access your most loved chats quickly or temporarily to not forget about things.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mute chats</strong> if you do not want to get notifications for them. Muted chats stay in place and you can also pin a muted chat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Archive chats</strong> if you do not want to see them in your chat list any longer.
Archived chats remain accessible above the chat list or via search.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When an archived chat gets a new message, unless muted, it will <strong>pop out of the archive</strong> and back into your chat list.
<strong>Muted chats stay archived</strong> until you unarchive them manually.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To archive or pin a chat, long tap (Android), use the chat’s menu (Android/Desktop) or swipe to the left (iOS);
to mute a chat, use the chat’s menu (Android/Desktop) or the chat’s profile (iOS).</p>

      </h3>

<ul>
  <li>Since Delta Chat 1.34 you can sometimes see a “green dot” next to the avatar
of a contact. It means they were “recently seen”.</li>
  <li>In detail: it means, that in the last 10 minutes, Delta Chat has seen them:
    <ul>
      <li>either because they messaged you directly,</li>
      <li>because they wrote something to a group you are both a member of,</li>
      <li>because they sent you a read receipt for a message you wrote,</li>
      <li>or because they sent data to your Delta Chat app by using a
<a href="#private-apps--webxdc">private app</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>So this is not a real time online status - and if someone doesn’t answer
right away even though they seem to be online, don’t worry and give them some
space ;-)</li>
  <li>On the other hand, others will not always “see that you are online”. If you
have turned off read receipts, they will not see the green dot until you
message them or write to a group they’re in as well.</li>

      </h3>

<p>The best way to ensure every message is encrypted,
and metadata deleted as quickly as possible
is creating a verified group and turning on
self-destructing messages.</p>

<p>Verified groups are always encrypted and protected against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">MITM
attacks</a>.</p>

<p>Metadata can’t be encrypted, as the server needs to know where to deliver your
messages. But turning on “self-destructing messages” deletes the messages on
the server after they were delivered.</p>

<p>If you need the messages on your device, but not on the server, you can also
agree in the group to turn on <a href="#what-happens-if-i-turn-on-delete-old-messages-from-server">“delete messages from server
automatically”</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to protect a 1:1 conversation like this, you should create a
verified group with only 2 people. If the other person loses their device but
not their account, you can still communicate in the 1:1 chat. (<a href="#what-is-the-difference-between-verified-groups-and-11-chats-with-verified-contacts">Read more</a>)</p>

    <p>1:1 chats with a verified contact and verified groups are not the same, even
if there are only 2 people in the verified group. One difference is that you
could easily add more people to the group, but there are other implications as
well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Verified groups are invariably secured. Any breakage (cleartext or wrongly
signed messages etc.) will be flagged and such messages will not be shown in
this chat. You can trust all messages in this verified-checkmark chat to have
not been read/altered by middle parties.</p>

  <li>
    <p>1:1 chats are opportunistic, it is meant to allow people to communicate no

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>No, OpenPGP doesn’t support Perfect Forward Secrecy. Perfect Forward Secrecy
works session-oriented, but E-Mail is asynchronous by nature
and often used from multiple devices independently. This means that if your
Delta Chat private key is leaked, and someone has a record
of all your in-transit messages, they will be able to read them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Note that if anyone has seized or hacked your running phone, they will
typically be able to read all messages, no matter if Perfect Forward Secrecy
is in place or not. Having access to a single device from a member of a group,
will typically expose a lot of the social graph. Using e-mail addresses that
are not easily tracked back to persons helps group members to stay safer from
the effects of device seizure.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As Delta Chat is a decentralized messenger, the metadata of Delta Chat users
are not stored on a single central server. However, they are stored on the mail
servers of the sender and the recipient of a message.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each mail server currently knows about who sent and who received a message by 
inspecting the unencrypted To/Cc headers and thus determine which e-mail addresses
are part of a group. Delta Chat itself could avoid unencrypted To/Cc headers quite 
and always put them only into the encrypted section. See 
<a href="https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/issues/1032">Avoid sending To/CC headers for verified groups</a>. 
For opportunistic chats the main concern is how it affects other mail apps who 
might participate in chats.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Yes. The best way is to send an Autocrypt Setup Message from the other e-mail client. Look for something like <strong>Start Autocrypt Setup Transfer</strong> in the settings of the other client and follow the instructions shown there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatively, you can import the key manually in “Settings -&gt; Advanced settings -&gt; Import secret keys”. Caution: Make sure the key is not protected by a password, or remove the password beforehand.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

      </h3>

<p>The most likely cause is that your key is encrypted and/or uses
a password. Such keys are not supported by Delta Chat.  You could remove the
passphrase encryption and the password and try the import again.  If you want
to keep your passphrase you’ll have to create an e-mail alias for use
with Delta Chat such that Delta Chat’s key is tied to this e-mail alias.</p>

<p>Delta Chat supports common OpenPGP private key formats, however, it
is unlikely that private keys from all sources will be fully supported. This
is not the main goal of Delta Chat. In fact, the majority of new users 
will not have any key prior to using Delta Chat.
We do, however, try to support private keys from as many sources as possible.</p>

<p>Removing the password from the private key will depend on the
software you use to manage your PGP keys. With Enigmail, you can set your
password to an empty value in the Key Management window. With GnuPG you can set
it <a href="https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-android/issues/98#issuecomment-378383429">via the command
line</a>.
For other programs, you should be able to find a solution online.</p>

<p>Sending a copy of your messages to yourself ensures that you receive your own
messages on all devices. If you have multiple devices and don’t turn it on, you
see only the messages from other people, and the messages you send from the
current device.</p>

<p>The copy is sent to the Inbox, and then moved to the DeltaChat folder; it’s not
put into the “Sent” folder. Delta Chat <em>never</em> uploads anything to the Sent
folder because this would mean uploading a message twice (once through SMTP,
and once through IMAP to Sent folder).</p>

  <li>This also means: it can be a privacy risk to open private apps in chats where
you don’t trust the members - as you know it from e-mail attachments, where 
you only open attachments from senders you trust, and not from spammers.</li>

      </h3>

<ul>
  <li>To turn on audio/video calls, go to the “experimental features” section in
the advanced settings and choose a “videochat instance”.</li>
  <li>When you invite others to a video chat, it is opened in your browser/app at
once. The others receive an e-mail with a link to your jitsi/BBB room. This
way, it is also compatible if your chat partners don’t use Delta Chat.</li>
  <li>Note that there is no ring tone on the other side, and your chat partners
will not get interrupted by a video chat invite.</li>
  <li>You can use any video chat service which allows joining by link. Just add the
link in the settings.</li>
  <li>For example, to use the flagship Jitsi Meet instance, you could enter
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://meet.jit.si/$ROOM</code>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ROOM</code> variable will be a random value;
this way, you will have a new random jitsi room every time you call someone.</li>

      </h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A verified group is a chat that guarantees safety against an active
attacker.  All Messages in a verified chat view are e2e-encrypted, and
members can join by scanning a “QR invite code”.  All members are thus 
connected with each other through a chain of invites, which guarantee 
cryptographic consistency against active network or provider attacks. 
See <a href="https://countermitm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/new.html">countermitm.readthedocs.io</a>
for the R&amp;D behind this feature.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As of Oct 2022, “verified groups” remain an experimental feature. It is
continuously improved and many bugs have been fixed since the original
introduction in 2018. However, there remain cases, especially with large
groups where inconsistencies can occur, or messages become unreadable.</p>

      </h3>

<ul>
  <li>With a Broadcast List you can send a message to many recipents at once; when
they reply to you, you get the reply in your direct 1:1 chat with them. The
recipients can’t see each other.</li>
  <li>Technically, it is an E-Mail with many recipients in BCC.</li>
  <li>You can turn on the feature in the “experimental features” section in the
advanced settings. Then you can create a Broadcast List from the “New Chat”
dialog.</li>
  <li>In case you are using more than one device, Broadcast Lists are currently not
synced between them.</li>
  <li>Messages sent to broadcast lists are not encrypted. Encryption would break
anonymity, because then all recipients would know who else received it
(Sending individual mails to everyone would be worse for rate limit and network
consumption reason).</li>

      </h3>

<ul>
  <li>You can turn on location streaming in the “experimental features” section of
the advanced settings.</li>
  <li>Now, if you want to share your location in a chat, go to “attach” and select
“location”. You can now set a time frame in which your location will be
streamed to your chat partners, between 5 minutes and 6 hours.</li>
  <li>When your location changes, the others in the chat can view it on a map in
the chat.</li>
  <li>To see the map and view locations of others, you need to turn on the feature
in the advanced settings.</li>
  <li>This feature will not share your location with anyone except your chat
partners. <em>But:</em> to show the map, we need to download map tiles from
mapbox.com, so if you <em>view</em> the map, mapbox.com is asked for the map of a
specific area. If this is a privacy risk for you, this feature might not be
for you. We are working on finding a decentralized alternative for Mapbox.</li>
  <li>On desktop, the OS typically can’t determine your location. Instead you can
right click on the map and describe a location, which is sent to the chat as
a message, but also appears on the map.</li>

      </h3>

<ul>
  <li>Right now, the database encryption is still very experimental. Don’t rely on
it for protection, you should additionally use encryption of your operating
system, if it provides any.</li>
  <li>The database encryption does not yet encrypt the blobs, only the rows and
columns of the database. This more or less means that your messages are safe,
but not your attachments.</li>
  <li>For iOS and Android, the encryption keys are stored in the system keychain.
This means the encryption is as secure as the operating system it’s running
on.</li>
  <li>The Delta Chat desktop client doesn’t offer database encryption yet, as there
is no standard way to store the encryption keys on the different supported
platforms.</li>

      </h3>

<p>This is an experimental setting for some people who are experimenting with
server-side rules. Not all providers support this, but with some you can move
all mails with a “Chat-Version” header to the DeltaChat folder. Normally, this
would be done by the Delta Chat app.</p>

<p>Enabling “Only Fetch from DeltaChat folder” makes sense if you have <strong>both</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enabled a server-side rule to move all messages with Chat-Version header to the DeltaChat folder, and</li>
  <li>have set the “Show classic emails” setting to “no, chats only”.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, Delta Chat doesn’t need to watch the Inbox, and it’s enough to only watch the DeltaChat folder.</p>

      </h3>

<ul>
  <li>Sending and receiving messages takes a few seconds, typically. Sometimes
there are cases where it takes longer but that is arguably true as well for
any other messenger.</li>
  <li>Instant chatting works fast if both parties are actively using the app. It’s
sometimes slower if the app is running in the background.</li>
  <li>Receiving messages then can take minutes because both Android and iOS often
stop Delta Chat from running in the background, and only wake it up
occasionally. This artificial delay is usually worse on iOS than on Android.</li>
  <li>However, Android and iOS kill apps running in the background is a
problem for many legitimate apps. For more information, see

      </h3>

<p>The Delta Chat project underwent three independent security audits in the last
years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In 2019, <a href="https://includesecurity.com">Include Security</a> analyzed Delta
Chat’s <a href="https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp">PGP</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/RustCrypto/RSA">RSA</a> libraries.
It found no critical issues,
but two high-severity issues that we subsequently fixed.
It also revealed one medium-severity and some less severe issues,
but there was no way to exploit these vulnerabilities in the Delta Chat implementation.
Some of them we nevertheless fixed since the audit was concluded.
You can read the <a href="../assets/blog/2019-first-security-review.pdf">full report here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 2020, <a href="https://includesecurity.com">Include Security</a> analyzed Delta
Chat’s Rust <a href="https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/">core</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/async-email/async-imap">IMAP</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/async-email/async-smtp">SMTP</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/async-email/async-native-tls">TLS</a> libraries.
It did not find any critical or high-severity issues.
The report raised a few medium-severity weaknesses -
they are no threat to Delta Chat users on their own
because they depend on the environment in which Delta Chat is used.
For usability and compatibility reasons,
we can not mitigate all of them
and decided to provide security recommendations to threatened users.
You can read the <a href="../assets/blog/2020-second-security-review.pdf">full report here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beginning 2023, <a href="https://cure53.de">Cure53</a> analyzed both the transport encryption of
Delta Chat’s network connections and a reproducible mail server setup as

<p>Delta Chat does not receive any Venture Capital and
is not indebted, and under no pressure to produce huge profits, or to 
sell users and their friends and family to advertisers (or worse). 
We rather use public funding sources, so far from EU and US origins, to help
our efforts in instigating a decentralized and diverse chat messaging eco-system
based on Free and Open-Source community developments.</p>

<p>Concretely, Delta Chat developments have so far been funded from these sources:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://nextleap.eu">NEXTLEAP</a> EU project funded the research
and implementation of verified groups and setup contact protocols
in 2017 and 2018 and also helped to integrate End-to-End Encryption
through <a href="https://autocrypt.org">Autocrypt</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://opentechfund.org">Open Technology Fund</a> gave us a 
first 2018/2019 grant (~$200K) during which we majorly improved the Android app 
and released a first Desktop app beta version, and which moreover 
moored our feature developments in UX research in human rights contexts, 
see our concluding <a href="https://delta.chat/en/2019-07-19-uxreport">Needfinding and UX report</a>.
The second 2019/2020 grant (~$300K) helped us to 
release Delta/iOS versions, to convert our core library to Rust, and
to provide new features for all platforms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://nlnet.nl/">NLnet foundation</a> granted in 2019/2020 EUR 46K for
completing Rust/Python bindings and instigating a Chat-bot ecosystem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 2021 we received further EU funding for two Next-Generation-Internet
proposals, namely for <a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu/hall-of-fame/eppd/">EPPD - e-mail provider portability directory</a> (~97K EUR) and <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/EmailPorting/">AEAP - email address porting</a> (~90K EUR) which resulted in better multi-account support, improved QR-code contact and group setups and many networking improvements on all platforms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From End 2021 till March 2023 we received <em>Internet Freedom</em> funding (500K USD) from the
U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL). 
This funding supported our long-running goals to make Delta Chat more usable 
and compatible with a wide range of e-mail servers world-wide, and more resilient and secure
in places often affected by internet censorship and shutdowns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beginning 2023 we got accepted in the Next Generation Internet (NGI)
Entrust program for our “Private Decentralized Apps” proposals. 
Exact amount is to be determined (around 100K EUR). 
This funding supports further developments of <a href="https://webxdc.org">webxdc “apps shared in a chat”</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes we receive one-time donations from private individuals. 
For example, in 2021 a generous individual bank-wired us 4K EUR 
with the subject “keep up the good developments!”. 💜 
We use such money to fund development gatherings or to care for ad-hoc expenses 
that can not easily be predicted for, or reimbursed from, public funding grants. 
Receiving more donations also helps us to become more independent and long-term viable
as a contributor community.</p>

    
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last but by far not least, several pro-bono experts and enthusiasts contributed 
and contribute to Delta Chat developments without receiving money, or only 
small amounts. Without them, Delta Chat would not be where it is today, not
even close.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The monetary funding mentioned above is mostly organized by merlinux GmbH in
Freiburg (Germany), and is distributed to more than a dozen contributors world-wide.</p>

<p>Please see <a href="https://delta.chat/en/contribute">Delta Chat Contribution channels</a>
