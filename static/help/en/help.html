      </h2>

<p>Delta Chat is a new chat app that sends messages via e-mails, encrypted if possible, with Autocrypt. 
<strong>You do not have to sign up anywhere, just use your existing e-mail account with Delta Chat.</strong></p>

<p>With Delta Chat, you can write to every existing e-mail address - even
if the recipient is not using the Delta Chat app. No need for the
recipient to install the same app as yours, as with other messengers.</p>

  <li>Messages from contacts <strong>contacted by you</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Replies</strong> to messages sent by you</li>

or add them via QR code, they automatically see it as your profile picture.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contacts who don’t use Delta Chat see it as an E-Mail attachment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For privacy reasons, no one sees your profile picture until you write a
message to them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your profile picture isn’t sent with every message, but regularly enough that

      </h3>

<p>As with other E-Mail programs like Thunderbird, K9-Mail, or Outlook, the
program needs the password so you can use it to send mails. Of course, the
password is stored only on your device. The password is only transmitted to
your E-Mail provider (when you login), which has access to your mails anyway.</p>

<p>If you use an E-Mail provider with OAuth2 support like gmail.com or yandex.ru,
there is no need to store your password on the device. In this case, only an
access token is used.</p>

<p>As Delta Chat is Open Source, you can check the <a href="https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/blob/master/src/login_param.rs">Source
Code</a>
if you want to verify that your credentials are handled securely. We are happy
about feedback which makes the app more secure for all of our users.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A verified group is a chat that gurantees safety against an active
attacker.  All Messages in a verified chat view are e2e-encrypted, and
members can join by scanning a “QR invite code”.  All members are thus 
connected with each other through a chain of invites, which guarantee 
cryptographic consistency against active network or provider attacks. 
See <a href="https://countermitm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/new.html">countermitm.readthedocs.io</a>
for the R&amp;D behind this feature.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As of Dec 2019, a “verified group” remains an experimental feature.
It is continously improved and many bugs have been fixed since the
original introduction in 2018.  However, there remain cases, especially 
with large groups where inconsistencies can occure, or messages become 
unreadable.  Early 2020 a security review is upcoming, and several new
developments around qr-join protocols are taking place so chances
are we remove the “experimental” label not too far in the future.</p>

“sender verified” system message in their 1:1 chat.</p>

  <li>
    <p>For end-to-end-encryption, Delta Chat shows two fingerprints there.

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>1:1 chats with a verified contact and verified groups are not the same, even
if there are only 2 people in the verified group. One difference is that you
could easily add more people to the group, but there are other implications as
well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Verified groups are invariably secured. Any breakage (cleartext or wrongly
signed messages etc.) will be flagged and such messages will not be shown in
this chat. You can trust all messages in this verified-checkmark chat to have
not been read/altered by middle parties.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1:1 chats are opportunistic, it is meant to allow people to communicate no
matter if they change e-mail clients, devices, setups etc. That’s why there
is no verification checkmark, even if you have verified the contact.</p>

          Does Delta Chat support Perfect Forward Secrecy? <a href="#does-delta-chat-support-perfect-forward-secrecy" class="anchor"></a>
        
        
      </h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>No, OpenPGP doesn’t support Perfect Forward Secrecy. Perfect Forward Secrecy
works session-oriented, but E-Mail is asynchronous by nature
and often used from multiple devices independently. This means that if your
Delta Chat private key is leaked, and someone has a record
of all your in-transit messages, they will be able to read them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Note that if anyone has seized or hacked your running phone, they will
typically be able to read all messages, no matter if Perfect Forward Secrecy
is in place or not. Having access to a single device from a member of a group,
will typically expose a lot of the social graph. Using e-mail addresses that
are not easily tracked back to persons helps group members to stay safer from
the effects of device seizure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are sketching ways to protect communications better against the event
of device seizure.</p>

      </h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As Delta Chat is a decentralized messenger, the metadata of Delta Chat users
are not stored on a single central server. However, they are stored on the mail
servers of the sender and the recipient of a message.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each mail server currently know about who sent and who received a message by 
inspecting the unencrypted To/Cc headers and thus determine which e-mail addresses
are part of a group. Delta Chat itself could avoid unencrypted To/Cc headers quite 
and always put them only into the encrypted section. See 
<a href="https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/issues/1032">Avoid sending To/CC headers for verified groups</a>. 
For opportunistic chats the main concern is how it affects other mail apps who 
might participate in chats.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many other e-mail headers, in particular the “Subject” header, are
end-to-end-encryption protected, see also this upcoming <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-autocrypt-lamps-protected-headers/">IETF
RFC</a>.</p>

      </h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Yes. The best way is to send an Autocrypt Setup Message from the other e-mail client. Look for something like <strong>Start Autocrypt Setup Transfer</strong> in the settings of the other client and follow the instructions shown there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatively, you can import the key manually in “Advanced settings / Manage private keys”. Caution: Make sure the key is not protected by a password, or remove the password beforehand.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t have a key or don’t even know you would need one - don’t worry: Delta Chat generates one as needed, you don’t have to hit a button for it.</p>

      </h3>

<p>With a very good chance, the problem is that your key is encrypted and/or uses
a password. Such keys are not supported by Delta Chat.  You may remove the
passphrase encryption and the password and try the import again.  If you want
to keep your passphrase you’ll have to create an e-mail alias for use
with Delta Chat such that Delta Chat’s key is tied to this e-mail alias.</p>

<p>Format wise, Delta Chat supports common OpenPGP private key formats, however, it
is unlikely that we will support 100% of all private keys of any sources. This
is also not the main focus of Delta Chat (in fact, the large majority of the
Delta Chat users will not have any key before they start using Delta).
However, we try to support private keys from other sources as good as possible.</p>

<p>Removing the password from the private key will be different, depending on the
software you use to manage your PGP keys. With Enigmail, you can set your
password to an empty value in the Key Management window. With GnuPG you can set
it <a href="https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-android/issues/98#issuecomment-378383429">via the command
line</a>.
For other programs, you can find a solution online.</p>

<p>If you want to use the <strong>same account</strong> on different (Autocrypt
capable) devices, you have to sync their encryption capabilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>On the first device, choose “Advanced settings / Send Autocrypt Setup message” 
and click until a “security number” is shown.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other device, wait for the “Autocrypt Setup Message” to
arrive and click on it, which should prompt you for the security number.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You are now synchronized, and can use both devices for
sending and receiving E2E-encrypted messages with your communication partners.</p>
  </li>
