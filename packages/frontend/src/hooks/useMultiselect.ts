/**
 * Helps implement keyboard (and mouse) -accessible multiselect behavior
 * on an existing widget.
 *
 * This hook is not concerned with how focus is managed
 * (be it arrow keys or something else).
 * But most of the time you want to make sure that focus can be managed
 * with arrow keys (roving tabindex),
 * so that the behavior is aligned with the recommended shortcuts
 * for the [Listbox pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/listbox/).
 *
 * @example
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const itemIds = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 * const [selectedItems, setSelectedItems] = useState(new Set<number>())
 * const multiselect = useMultiselect(itemIds, selectedItems, setSelectedItems)
 * const myOnClick = useCallback((id: number) => {
 *   console.log('Clicked item', id)
 * }, [])
 * return (
 *   <ul
 *     role='listbox' // Or 'tablist' or whatever.
 *     aria-multiselectable={true}
 *   >
 *     {itemIds.map(id => (
 *       <li>
 *         <button
 *           role='option' // Or 'tab' or whatever.
 *           aria-selected={multiselect.selectedItems.has(id)}
 *           className={multiselect.selectedItems.has(id) ? 'selected' : ''}
 *           onClick={event => {
 *             const shouldPreventDefault = multiselect.onClick(event, id)
 *             if (shouldPreventDefault) {
 *               event.preventDefault()
 *               return
 *             }
 *             // The "regular", non-multiselect click action.
 *             myOnClick(id)
 *           }}
 *           onFocus={() => multiselect.onFocus(id)}
 *         >
 *           Item {id}
 *         </button>
 *       </li>
 *     ))}
 *   </ul>
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * This does not provide the most advanced selection behavior,
 * for example, Shift + Click will reset previous selection,
 * which is annoying.
 * But it will work for 95% of user needs.
 *
 * If you are looking for a more thorough library, consider
 * https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/selection.html.
 * In particular, see
 * [`useSelectableCollection`](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/blob/e6772602376d9726f2347ff0eb2d379b4cd256a9/packages/%40react-aria/selection/src/useSelectableCollection.ts#L107C17-L323).
 *
 * The items in DOM must be focusable and interactive (e.g. `<button>`s).
 * Interactivity is required because we listen on `click` events
 * as opposed to `keydown` events with `.code === "Space"`,
 * because we support both keyboard and mouse selection.
 *
 * If items are removed from {@link availableItems},
 * they will not be automatically removed from {@link selectedItems}.
 * Make sure to handle this yourself, to avoid confusing behavior
 * where items are selected, but are not visible on the screen.
 *
 * It is also possible to provide {@link selectedItems} Set
 * that includes items which are not a part of {@link availableItems}.
