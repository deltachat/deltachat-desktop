// from https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1921#issuecomment-1898197331
// read the issue for more context, basically esbuild can not convert cjs style `require()` calls to import calls (yet).
// and since we output esm, "require" is not avaiable unless we bing it back with this trick.
// Another option would be to only use esm dependencies, but that's too much work at the time of writing this.
