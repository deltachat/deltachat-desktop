## Build for mobile

### iOS

Note that this was just a fun sidequest for simon at the time, so don't expect it to work.

```
pnpm tauri ios init
pnpm tauri ios dev --no-dev-server
```

This currently doens't work for me, it shows a runtime error, but installing the IPA generated by this command over xcode devices window works fine:
```
pnpm tauri ios build
```
