## Update core

To update core and the other dependencies:

go into repo root then run

```
./bin/link_core/link_version.js <version>
```

(the version needs to be specified without `v` in the beginning)

example:

```
./bin/link_core/link_version.js 1.153.0
```

### update core manually if there is a dependency issue

Sometimes there are dependency conflicts, if there are you need to edit `packages/target-tauri/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` manually.

run `cargo update` in `packages/target-tauri/src-tauri`.

## Quirks

- When you edit runtime or frontend code you need to restart the "tauri dev" command, otherwise the changes might not be picked up.

## Differences between devmode and release mode

- in devmode autostart is disabled by default, because the result would be unexpected for developers. In release mode this option is enabled by default.
