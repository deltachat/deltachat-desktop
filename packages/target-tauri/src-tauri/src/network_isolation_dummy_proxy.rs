/*!
A dummy TCP listener that does nothing except occupy a port.

This TCP listener is to be used as a proxy for certain windows of our app,
such as webxdc windows and HTML email viewer windows,
where we need to ensure network isolation.
Setting an invalid proxy should make the browser unable to perform requests,
at least to some degree.

Providing just any address (e.g. `127.0.0.1:123`)
where we don't expect a valid proxy is not good,
because
1. Theoretically there could actually be a proxy listening there.
2. If something is listening on that port, even if that is not a valid proxy,
   we still don't want to direct any traffic there.
   This could be classified as the "confused deputy" problem
   ([CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('Confused Deputy')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/441.html)).

So we need to occupy the port.
