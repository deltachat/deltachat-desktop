# End to end tests

## Install playwright

after running `pnpm install`

cd into packages/e2e-tests

and run `npx playwright install --with-deps`

A convenient alternative to install and use playwright is the VSCode [plugin](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode). It also provides some functionality for running or recording tests.

Copy packages/e2e-tests/\_env to packages/e2e-tests/.env

## Usage

This package depends on the target-browser so make sure you prepared that to run (adding custom certificates). See [README](../packages/target-browser/Readme.md)

But don't run the browser at the same time, it will be started inside the test routine.

```sh
pnpm -w e2e
```

for headless usage

or

```sh
pnpm -w e2e --ui
```

for [UI mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui-mode)

```sh
pnpm -w e2e basic
```

to run only tests in file basic-tests.spec.ts (all tests that match by second parameter)

```sh
pnpm -w --filter e2e-tests e2e:report
```

to show the last report

The account dir for tests is in _packages/e2e-tests/data/accounts_ (configurable in .env)

It can be deleted after running tests and will be recreated in the next run.

## Troubleshooting

Make sure that there are no accounts left after fail.
`rm -r packages/e2e-tests/data/accounts`

After failing tests or stopping tests with Ctrl + C sometimes either the rpc-server process is still running or the used port is still blocked by a process
To find the related process pid (on Linux) run:

`ps -aef | grep rpc-server` or for the process blocking the port:

`lsof -i:3000`
